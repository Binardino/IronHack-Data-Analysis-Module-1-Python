There are multiple ways of combining strings in Python, as well as combining strings with variables. We will explore this in the first challenge. In the cell below, combine the strings in the list and add spaces between the strings (do not add a space after the last string). Insert a period after the last string."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"'Durante un tiempo no estuvo segura de si su marido era su marido'"},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":"str_list = ['Durante', 'un', 'tiempo', 'no', 'estuvo', 'segura', 'de', 'si', 'su', 'marido', 'era', 'su', 'marido']\n# Your code here:\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"In the cell below, use the list of strings to create a grocery list.

There are times where we need to do the opposite and split the string into smaller components for further analysis. \n\nIn the cell below, split the string into a list of strings using the space delimiter. Count the frequency of each word in the string in a dictionary. Strip the periods, line breaks and commas from the text.
